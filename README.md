# Werewolf Guide
This is a collection of rules and characters for the social deduction game Werewolf (Mafia) as I and my friends often play it.  
I intend to use it as reference for the players and myself when hosting larger games. I'm swiss so the content is written in german, with some swiss-german thrown in at some places.  
Maybe I'll also translate it into english later on just because I love this game.
